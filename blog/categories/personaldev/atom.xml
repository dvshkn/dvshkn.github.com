    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is David Knight, and I'm a software engineer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>This is actually the third version of the first post that I've written, where
each revision is a little less long-winded than the previous one. I'll try to
keep this one short and sweet. This blog is a place for me to write down my
thoughts on programming and technology in addition to writing about some more
general interests like food, space exploration, environmentalism, philosophy,
college football, etc.</p>

<p>My main motivator for writing here is to help reverse the atrophy that my
writing skills have underwent since I finished college. Additionally, it's
refreshing to work on a self-directed side project, and it's a bonus that it
can serve as a creative output and a catalog of thoughts and hobbies.</p>

<p>In the near future, I plan to post a short bio page and a running list of past
miscellaneous projects that I've found enjoyable.</p>
