My name is David Knight, and I'm a software engineer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

This is actually the third version of the first post that I've written, where
each revision is a little less long-winded than the previous one. I'll try to
keep this one short and sweet. This blog is a place for me to write down my
thoughts on programming and technology in addition to writing about some more
general interests like food, space exploration, environmentalism, philosophy,
college football, etc.

My main motivator for writing here is to help reverse the atrophy that my
writing skills have underwent since I finished college. Additionally, it's
refreshing to work on a self-directed side project, and it's a bonus that it
can serve as a creative output and a catalog of thoughts and hobbies.

In the near future, I plan to post a short bio page and a running list of past
miscellaneous projects that I've found enjoyable.
